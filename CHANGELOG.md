# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- Thread-aware reply routing: replies no longer mix up when multiple threads in the same group are active concurrently. Plugin now tracks the latest inbound message per (chat, thread) and auto-corrects `reply_to` when Claude passes `thread_id` but omits `reply_to`.

### Added
- `thread_id` parameter to the `reply` tool — pass it so the plugin can auto-route into the correct thread
- `LatestMessageTracker` with 10-minute TTL

### Changed
- `MessageQueue` now keys by `chatId:threadId` instead of `chatId` — different threads in the same group process in parallel
- Instructions updated to emphasize strict message_id ↔ `<channel>` tag matching

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Marketplace metadata: version, homepage, category, keywords in marketplace.json and plugin.json
- CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format
- Smoke tests (`npm test`): typecheck, dry-run, stdout cleanliness
