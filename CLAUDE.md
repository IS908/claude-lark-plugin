# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Claude Lark Plugin is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) channel plugin that connects Claude Code to Feishu/Lark via WebSocket. It receives messages from Feishu users, enriches them with memory context, and forwards them to Claude Code. Responses flow back through the Feishu IM API.

## Commands

```bash
npm start              # Run with tsx (development)
npm run build          # Compile TypeScript to dist/
npm run typecheck      # Type-check without emitting
bash scripts/start.sh  # Production launcher (loads lark-cli skills)
npm start -- --dry-run # Validate config and module loading without connecting
```

## Architecture

```
src/index.ts        – Entry point: wires MCP server, LarkChannel, memory, and buffer together
src/config.ts       – Loads config from ~/.claude/channels/lark/.env (dotenv)
src/channel.ts      – LarkChannel: Feishu WebSocket client, message parsing, memory enrichment pipeline
src/tools.ts        – Registers 6 MCP tools: reply, edit_message, react, download_attachment, save_memory, save_skill
src/queue.ts        – Per-chat sequential message queue
src/memory/
  interface.ts      – MemoryProvider interface (Episodes, Profiles, Skills)
  factory.ts        – Provider factory (file | openviking | mem0 stub)
  file.ts           – File-based provider (default, stores in ~/.claude/channels/lark/memories/)
  openviking.ts     – OpenViking vector search provider (stub)
  mem0.ts           – mem0 managed memory provider (stub)
  buffer.ts         – In-memory ring buffer with auto-flush on inactivity
  distiller.ts      – Builds flush prompts to distill buffer into episodic memory
```

**Data flow:** Feishu event → `LarkChannel.handleMessageEvent` → whitelist check → ack reaction (MeMeMe) → text extraction → image auto-download → enqueue per-chat → record in buffer → enrich with memory (profile + episodes + skills) → forward via `notifications/claude/channel` → Claude calls `reply` tool → response sent back to Feishu → ack reaction revoked.

**Reaction flow:** Feishu reaction event → `handleReactionEvent` → filter (bot self, bot messages only, whitelists) → forward to Claude via channel notification.

## Key Design Decisions

- **ESM-only**: `"type": "module"` in package.json; all imports use `.js` extensions.
- **Stdio transport**: MCP server communicates via stdin/stdout; all debug logging goes to `console.error`.
- **Single-instance lock**: PID-based lock file in `/tmp/` prevents duplicate WebSocket connections.
- **Config location**: All user config lives at `~/.claude/channels/lark/.env`, not in the repo.
- **Memory is pluggable**: `MemoryProvider` interface with three backends; `file` and `openviking` are implemented (mem0 is a stub).
- **Image auto-download**: Images are downloaded to `~/.claude/channels/lark/inbox/` on receive. Claude reads local paths via `image_path` in notification meta.
- **Ack reaction**: Configurable emoji (`LARK_ACK_EMOJI`, default `MeMeMe`) sent on receive, auto-revoked after reply. Fire-and-forget, won't block message processing.
- **Bot message tracking**: `BotMessageTracker` (default 500, FIFO, configurable via `LARK_BOT_MESSAGE_TRACKER_SIZE`) tracks bot-sent message IDs. Used to filter reaction events — only reactions on bot messages are forwarded to Claude.

## Configuration

Required env vars: `LARK_APP_ID`, `LARK_APP_SECRET` (in `~/.claude/channels/lark/.env`).

The `/lark:configure` skill (in `skills/configure/SKILL.md`) provides interactive setup within Claude Code.

## Important Conventions

- **Stdout is sacred**: MCP uses stdio for JSON-RPC. All logging must go to `console.error`, never `console.log`. The Lark SDK uses custom loggers to redirect to stderr.
- **`.mcp.json` must use `--silent`**: Prevents npm script lifecycle output from corrupting MCP transport.
- **Channel protocol**: Messages are forwarded to Claude via `notifications/claude/channel` (not `sendLoggingMessage`). Requires `experimental: { 'claude/channel': {} }` capability.
- **User display names**: Resolved via contact API → cached. Falls back to stable aliases (`user_` + last 7 chars of open_id). Memory keys always use raw open_id/chat_id.
- **Group chat filtering**: Only messages with @bot mentions are processed (precise match via bot open_id fetched at startup). P2P messages are always processed.
- **Reaction events**: Subscribed to `im.message.reaction.created_v1`. Filtered: ignores bot's own reactions, non-bot messages, and respects whitelists.

## Debugging

Debug logs are written to `~/.claude/channels/lark/debug.log`. Contains raw event data (sender, mentions, chatType) for diagnosing message flow issues.

Plugin code runs from three locations — all must stay in sync during development:
- `workspace` (source of truth)
- `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/claude-lark-plugin/` (marketplace clone)
- `~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-lark-plugin/lark/<version>/` (Claude Code runtime cache)
